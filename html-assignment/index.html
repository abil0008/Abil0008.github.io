        <p>Hello, my name is <em>Joe Abi-lamaa</em> and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year of the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> Program. 
            I enrolled in this program in hopes to find a clear path of my career.
                I have always struggled to find a suitable program, and this would be my third attempt.
                    I am really enjoying this program for the first time and hope to achieve a proper career path and do well in my studies!</p>

        <h4>Second Paragraph</h4>
            <p>I am a 20 year old lebanese born in canada and have done all my studies in school in french.
                Throughout my life, I have always struggled to find passion with things, or just even be interested in a topic, up until recently.
                    My first passion was music, or the piano. I did study music and criminology at <em>Carleton University</em>, but lost interest very quickly, and decided to just keep it as a personal hobby.
                        Then when the pandemic started, I picked up video editing, and started doing youtube and twitch for fun.
                    I have had videos reach thousands of viewers and have a good average view/fan base on my Twitch account, and am still new at it!
                I really find this enjoyable and want to pick up more adobe programs, and other media based passions, hence why I took the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program! </p>

    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Hobby 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Music
        </ul>
    <p>I have been playing the piano since I was 14, and was mostly self taught. 
        I learned piano through Youtube, by watching where the notes are gonna be hit, and just checked for myself.
            Not a very efficient way of learning, yet I managed, and went from grade 1 to 8 within a year! 
                I then took lessons and was very enjoyable as I had an amazing teacher who was understanding and not strict
                    She was very impressed with me!</p>
                        
    <h3>Hobby 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Video Editing</li>
    </ul>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">*I couldn't change the bullet holes while using dl, so I had to change it with a ul tag*</p>
   
<p>I randomly picked up video editing when the pandemic started.
        I first started out with this free editing program called <em>Filmora</em>, and really had fun just messing around, making videos/memes about my friend.
            I then saw how limited this program was and went to <em>Adobe Premiere Pro</em>!
                Enjoying the new and many options I had, I quickly got better at it and decided to upload to Youtube!
                    I occasionally post and have had videos reach thousands of views, which enourages me to do this on the side!
                        Who knows what would happen...?</p>
