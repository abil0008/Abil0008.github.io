        <p>Hello, my name is <em>Joe Abi-lamaa</em> and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year of the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> Program. 
            I enrolled in this program in hopes to find a clear path of my career.
                I have always struggled to find a suitable program, and this would be my third attempt.
                    I am really enjoying this program for the first time and hope to achieve a proper career path and do well in my studies!</p>

        <h4>Second Paragraph</h4>
            <p>I am a 20 year old lebanese born in canada and have done all my studies in school in french.
                Throughout my life, I have always struggled to find passion with things, or just even be interested in a topic, up until recently.
                    My first passion was music, or the piano. I did study music and criminology at <em>Carleton University</em>, but lost interest very quickly, and decided to just keep it as a personal hobby.
                        Then when the pandemic started, I picked up video editing, and started doing youtube and twitch for fun.
                    I have had videos reach thousands of viewers and have a good average view/fan base on my Twitch account, and am still new at it!
                I really find this enjoyable and want to pick up more adobe programs, and other media based passions, hence why I took the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program!
